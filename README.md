# NPC Comment Blocker

This is a simple plugin that blocks NPC comments in the youtube chatbox
Example of NPC comments:

```
- Whose here in [year]?
0% NUDITY
0% DRUGS
100% TALENT
```

## Installation

1. Download/Clone the repository

2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.

3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

4. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

## Usage

The extension will automatically block NPC comments in the youtube comment section.Since its in development there isnt a way to turn it off/on yet.

## Roadmap

- Add a toggle button to turn the extension on/off
- Add a way to add custom comments to block
- Add an authentication system to block comments based on the user's preference
- Add an option to modify the comments instead of blocking them
- Improve the comments blocked and implement a better regex system
